The digital record also includes a QR code that when scanned by a SMART Health Card reader will display to the reader your name, date of birth, vaccine dates and vaccine type. The QR code also confirms the vaccine record as an official record of your state.",
  "faqpage.02question": "How will my verification record be delivered?",
  "faqpage.02answer": "When your verification record is found, you will receive a link delivered to the email or mobile phone number associated with the vaccination record.

  "faqpage.05answer": "<0>No. If you receive an additional dose or booster dose, it will not automatically reflect on your digital verification record.

  "faqpage.10question": "Will my information remain private?",
